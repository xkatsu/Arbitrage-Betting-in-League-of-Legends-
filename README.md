# Arbitrage-Betting-in-League-of-Legends-
YOU WILL NEED PANDAS AND SELENIUM ON YOUR BROWSER CURRENT VERSION!!!


A prototype of a big program that scrap bettinghouses league odds and compare with a csv generated by riot API, showing the real probability of secondary markets and fair odds that differ from those offered by bookies  


To make correct usage of the program you need to understand that sometimes riot API gives different names for what we scrapped from betting houses, so keep in mind to change both time_a or both time_b if that happen
